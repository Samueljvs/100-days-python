# Doing the 100 days of python

Keen to do the 100 days of python to upskill a bit more and ground out my foundational knowledge. Coming from an R backgroun in Data Science, it will be a nice addition to the tool kit.
Hopefully get this all done in 100 days.

Update: 5/8/25 - 1 year later, finally getting back into it
